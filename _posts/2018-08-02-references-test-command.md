# Test Commands
***
This document refers to the Command Editor options and not JavaScript API to call a command. JavaScript API for the test case step can be viewed by clicking the label for the step. API inputs may not be named exactly the same as Command Editor fields. For example, **Assignee** in the Dialog box corresponds to a **user** in the API.


  ![][command_start_process_javascript_API]

  ![][command_start_process_editor]

There are five(5) categories of commands:

* [BPM](#bpm)
* [BPM Assertion](#bpm-assertion)
* [UI](#ui)
* [UI assertion](#ui-assertion)
* [Utility](#utility)

___

### **BPM**

This category of commands are for calling server side components. There are a lot of common input fields. Below are some statements which are common for most of the commands in this category.  

___

**Assignee:** When specified, the command is executed by the specified BPM user. Drop down lists all *BPM user names* defined in the BPM Configuration the Test Project is connected to. More details refer to [**BPM Configuration/Add user to a BPM server**][1].

**Exception:** is an exception case. Checked means we are expecting to get an error for the test case. Unchecked means we are expecting to get a normal result from the test case.

**Comment:** Optional. Not part of any command and can be used for documenting test case step.

**Params:** Json format. If the template of parameters is rendered successfully by selecting service, the field is required. The parameters are defaulted based on the service signature. The template of parameters includes keys of data and you only need to fill in value. *e.g:*

    {
	"variable_name": "value",
	"variable2_name": "value2"
    }

The ![][command_params_error_icon] icon will appears below *Expected Output* input box when the wrong *Params* is filled out after click ![][command_expected_output_refresh_button] button in the Command Editor Dialog. The error message can be got by hovering on the ![][command_params_error_icon] icon.

**Expected Output:** Used for validating command response. In some cases, there is a refresh button, which can be used to get default expected results. Make sure to fill out params before clicking refresh. If refresh does not work, execute the case step with out expectedOutput set. If passed, edit the step and click on ![][command_expected_output_refresh_button] button in the Command Editor Dialog to capture the results.

**TaskName:** Drop down lists all task names in the Process Application of the Test Project which is connected to.

**Json Path:** Json path to a variable in the output json data.

**Variable Name:** Variable name to save the value the json path points to. This variable can be accessed via ${variable_name} in later commands in this test case.

___

### **UI**  

In most cases, the UI commands are recorded using the IDA plug in. If you find a need to add a command manually, for example, validation command, look at the recorded command for the element and copy the location information from it.
<br>*e.g:*
Any one or combination of the recorded values can be used to identify the control:  Control ID, Element ID or XPATH. If Label is unique on the page, it can be used as well. Enough location arguments are required to uniquely identify an element on the page. **IDA** cycles through available ids until it finds the element. For example, if you recorded a select step and later moved the control around on the page, the Control ID and XPATH are probably different from the recorded step, but Element ID is still the same.

Here are statements of common input fields.

___

**Assignee:** When specified, the command is executed by the specified BPM user. Drop down lists all *BPM user names* defined in the BPM Configuration of the Test Project which is connected to. More details refer to [**BPM Configuration/Add user to a BPM server**][1].

**Value:** The value of the control.

**Contorl ID:** The ID of the control. Control ID is the PATH control IDs leading to the selected control id.

**Label:** The label of the control.

**Element ID:** The ID of the element.

**Element CSS:** The CSS of the element.

**XPATH:** The xpath of the control.

**Comment:** Optional. Not part of any command and can be used for documenting test case step.

***Notes:** The element is first obtained through the Control ID. If is failed, the label, Element ID and Element CSS are then used in turn. Finally is XPATH. If is successful, the rest will not be used.*

  | saveCoachControl       | Key : Key is a name of a variable, which can later be referenced as ${key} in a value field of any command. <br>Property : When the control binding complex object, you can get the value form complex object by property. <br> *eg:* <br> *bindingObject.value*|  Put the control value into a key. <br>Tip:<br> a) record a step to set the value of the control;<br>b) edit the recorded step in Command Editor and change the command to saveCoachControl;<br>c) set the Key.<br> If the control you try to save is read only, record any other control in the located at the same level ( e.g in the container ).  Modify the Control ID path to match the control you are trying to save.|  
  | saveText               | Key : Key is a name of a variable, which can later be referenced as ${key} in a value field of any command. |  Can put the output text, single select and input value to a key.                                   |   
  | select                 |Refer to common statements.              |  Set the value of select (drop down) control. Value is a json list of selected display values for this Select or Multi Select CV. <br>*e.g:*``["Selected value1","Selected value2"] ``|
  | selectWindow           |Info: window information.                 |    Select window by window info.|                                      
  | text                   |Refer to common statements.                   |Set the value of any control, which UI accepts textual input. Example: input text CV, Integer CV, Date Picker. This event is captured when the control loses focus. So it is possible for some controls like Date Picker to record 2 steps. One for empty value and the other for actual value. It is because the first empty data is captured when the mouse focus moves from control to the Data select popup. Users can remove the first recorded case step or just keep them as-is.|    
  | waitElement            |Type: select the element type from drop down. *Visible*, *Hidden*, *Enabled* and *Disabled*.<br>Timeout: the maximum time that wait for the element.| Wait for an element until timeout|
  | waitTextPresent        |Text: t that waits for displaying on the page.<br>Timeout: the maximum time that wait for the text. | Wait for displaying a text until timeout.|
