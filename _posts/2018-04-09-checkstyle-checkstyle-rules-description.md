| check-app-too-many-toolkit                         | MAJOR    | Check the total number of the toolkits in the application to ensure it is not more than 25.                          | A process application that includes a large number of toolkits will have runtime performance issues. Avoid deeply nested toolkit hierarchy (toolkits that include toolkits that include toolkits...). Create toolkits as per logical domains instead of creating one huge toolkit, and prior to deployment create temporary toolkits that contain only the artifacts actually used in your process application. | Performance    |
