Create toolkits as per logical domains instead of creating one huge toolkit, and prior to deployment create temporary toolkits that contain only the artifacts actually used in your process application. | Performance    |

Large JavaScript blocks can also produce very large Document Object Model (DOM) trees. As a general guideline, limit a JavaScript block to 100 lines. If your implementation exceeds this value, re-evaluate the design and re-factor the implementation to use smaller JavaScript blocks. | JavaScript     | [IBM BPM Performance Tuning and Best Practices](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg248216.pdf) |
