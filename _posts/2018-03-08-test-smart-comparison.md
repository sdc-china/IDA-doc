# Test Smart Comparison - A new image base assertion
***
### How does smart comparison work

 Smart comparison is an image based assertion, which is a new and easy way for regression test assertion using pixel-by-pixel comparison.
  - run and record your test case as usual,
  - review screenshots, if it's the expected result, enable it as a base image,
  - run test case again and then the smart comparison engine will diff the new screenshot with the base image. Any difference, the test step will be marked as failed and reports **Screenshot does not match the expected image in smart comparison** error. 
    
### Enable Smart Comparison

   **Notes:**
  Before starting smart comparison, please make sure that the test case already finish running and has a report. The status of the report is **Passed** and there is at least one case step with screenshot.

If you don't want to compare the whole image, you can specify the area to compare by moving the mouse over the screenshot, then clicking, dragging and select the area you want to compare. Release the mouse and can see the selected part is shown: 
  
      ![][cropped_image]

Click the screenshot, the comparison area will be set with different background color, and the differences between the expected image has been set in smart comparison page and current screenshot will be highlighted in red line. Hover the mouse over the **Expected Screenshot** can get the expected screenshot :
  
  
      ![][test_result]   
      
      ![][expected_image]
      
      If there is nothing different, current screenshot will be shown and status is **Passed**.
