Edit [IDA_HOME]/conf/**ida.properties** under **conf** folder. This properties file contains three main sections.

**application configuration**
   
*  **spring.datasource.username** : Database connection username  
*  **spring.datasource.password** : Database connection password  
*  **spring.datasource.url** : Database connection URL
*  **server.host** :  IDA server IP or host name
*  **server.context-path** : default as  "/ida"  
*  **http.port** : Liberty http port defined in the server.xml
*  **https.port** : Liberty https port defined in the server.xml
*  **engineConfig.connectionTimeout** :  page load timeout
*  **engineConfig.waitTimeout** :  default wait timeout, used in waitTextPresent and waitElement commands    
*  **engineConfig.retryTimes** :  retry the failed command by the given times
*  **engineConfig.retryInterval** : the interval time  between the retry.The default is 3 seconds    
*  **engineConfig.dataDir** :  Temp folder to keep resouces like screenshot,checkstyle,twx etc  
*  **smtp.host** : SMTP host    
*  **smtp.port** : SMTP port    
*  **email.from** : Sender Email address 
*  **spring.activemq.broker-url** : IP and Port of embedded ActiveMQ. It is only needed when you integrate IDA with BPM DEF[1] to have the monitoring feature. By default this property is commented out. You can leave it as-is if you don't need the monitoring feature. If you need it, you can uncomment it and replace the localhost with the actual IP address of the IDA deployment server.
*  **deployment.timeout** : The timeout in seconds for REST API call to check if snapshot is installed on PS and set as default snapshot
*  **deployment.interval** : The interval in seconds for REST API call to check if snapshot is installed on PS and set as default snapshot

*  **enable_case_history** : Enable save test case history function, default value is true.  
*  **max_case_history** : Set latest test case history max number of each test case, default value is 100.  

**Notes** 
If you want to use encrypt database password in the **spring.datasource.password**.You need to generate the encrypt password.There are two ways to generate it.The secret key is define in the **jasypt.encryptor.password**.
You can use [online web tool](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/jasypt-online-encryption-decryption) to generate encrypted password.

Also you can use command line tool from [jasypt](http://www.jasypt.org/download.html) to generate.

Once you get the encrypt password,you need to change spring.datasource.password like below format.As a general rule, jasypt expects encrypted configuration parameters to appear surrounded by "ENC(...)".    
spring.datasource.password: ENC(Yasd1hzrpo05EdNTzlifQ22+8LUNAgcT)     

 
**checkstyle properties configuration**

*  **checkstyle.engine**: The checkstyle engine property can be EMBEDDED or ODM. By default, it's *EMBEDDED*. You need configure the following ODM server and rules configuration if you use ODM as checkstyle engine.
*  **resUser** : rule execution server username  
*  **resPassword** : rule execution server password  
*  **resUrl** : rule execution server url  
*  **resPort** : rule execution server port 
*  **restUrl** : The checkstyle rule ODM REST url

**monitoring properties configuration (For BPM Monitoring purpose)**
	
*  **event_type** : event types to be stored in IDA database  
*  **track_serviceflow** : default as true  

It is only needed when you want to configure monitoring[1] to have the monitoring feature. If you don't need it, you can leave them as-is.

#### Configure Database properties
You can uncomment DB2 property configuration and comment MySQL property configuration.

**Notes**   

If you want your IDA support Latin alphabet in page,you need to add **useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8** at the end of jdbc url.

### Repacking IDA-web with configuration

The purpose of repackage  is to update your application-product.yaml in the war to make sure it loads the recent configuration.Once all the properties in [IDA_HOME]/conf/ida.properties file have been updated, you can then re-package the [IDA_HOME]/build/**ida-web.war** file.  

Before running the [IDA_HOME]/**package.bat** or [IDA_HOME]/**package.sh** you will need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable and make ensure that [JAVA_HOME]/bin is included in the variable.  Once the environment variable is set , you can then execute the package shell command to repackage the **ida-web.war**.
