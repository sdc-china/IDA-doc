Create toolkits as per logical domains instead of creating one huge toolkit, and prior to deployment create temporary toolkits that contain only the artifacts actually used in your process app. | Performance    |

| check-bpd-searchable-field                      | CRITICAL | Check the total number of searchable field in a BPD or Process to ensure it is not more than 10.                                                    | Business variables add more overhead to the process server, limit business data searches to only those fields that need to be searchable in the Process Portal. As a general guideline, rarely are more than 10 searchable variables required in a " + the type name of 'the bpd' + ". If your implementation has more searchable variables than this, re-evaluate your design and re-factor as needed to reduce the number of searchable variables. | Performance    |[IBM BPM Performance Tuning and Best Practices](http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4935.pdf)  |

| check-ad-hoc-start-event               | MAJOR | Check all the omponents in the bpds, ensure that  there is no ad-hoc start event.                                                                                           | Ad hoc start events are detected. These events are converted to a Start Message event with no UCA implementation when the BPD is converted to process. You need to change the event to an ad hoc activity and implement it as a subprocess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Migration | [IBM BPM Info Center Converting BPD](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/proc_convbpd.html)          |
| check-deprecated-task-routing-policy   | MAJOR | The assignment options such as Last User in Lane, Routing Policy, List of Users and Custom under an Activity's Properties in IBM Process Designer are deprecated from V8.5. | Instead of Last User in Lane, select Lane from the AssignTo list and select Last User from the User Distribution list in the Assignments section under an Activity's Properties. Instead of Routing Policy, List of Users, and Custom options, select the Team business object from the AssignTo list. You can use the team retrieval and team filter services to define a team of members dynamically within the service implementation. The runtime environment in IBM BPM V8.5 then uses the Team business object that is returned by the service for assignments. | Migration | [IBM BPM Info Center Converting BPD](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/proc_convbpd.html)          |
